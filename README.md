# Gender-Clasify
Using Naive Bayes classifier and using @jcharis work I put it all in one script just to make it user friendlier. It ask for an excel sheet with the names and it produces a new one with the genders. This was useful to me at work where we have a bunch of data collected and they made me assign gender for every person based only on the name. I decided to make this, I hope this is useful to somebody else.

# Note:
## The script will look for a column name named "nombre" since I made it to work for a spanish speaking office. You can modify the code to look for "name" easily.
